# APCSP-Tima

This is a catalog of an experienced programmer's solutions to APCSP assignments

Solutions will be committed here every day. <br/> 
Don't expect the code to be formatted, don't have time for that :)

**Somewhy, CodingBat is still on Python 2, so some functions (like match-case) aren't valid.**
