# AP-CSP Assignments

## Purpose

There is absolutely no purpose for this, I could've easily kept all these on my computer,
but _**why not?**_ :o

Solutions to the assignments from AP-CSP will be committed here every day we have one. <br/> 
Don't expect the code to be formatted, don't have time for that :)

**Somewhy, CodingBat is still on Python 2, so some functions (like match-case) aren't valid.**
