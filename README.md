# APCSP-Tima

This is a catalog of an experienced programmer's solutions to APCSP assignments

Solutions will be committed here every day. <br/>
Don't just copy my code, this is to help people understand what we're doing and to present fun solutions. 

**Somewhy, CodingBat is still on Python 2, so some functions (like match-case) aren't valid.**
